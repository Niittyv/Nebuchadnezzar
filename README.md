# Nebuchadnezzar

MQL5 programming language is very similar to C++. I implemented concurrent programming to create a trading robot that works in real-time market environment. The trading robot is fully functional on Metatrader 5 platform.


There are two seperate algorithms trading two different strategies:

1. The trend follower algorithm trades breakouts of the formation of previous candles.

2. The mean reverter algorithm trades rejections of the lows and highs of the formation of previous candles.
