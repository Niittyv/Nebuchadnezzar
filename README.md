# Nebuchadnezzar

MQL5 programming language is very similar to C++. I implemented concurrent programming to make the trading robot work in live market environment. The trading robot is fully functional on Metatrader 5 platform.


There are two seperate algorithms trading two different strategies:

1. The trend follower algorithm trades breakouts of previous candle formation.

2. The mean reverter algorithm trades rejections of the lows and highs of previous candle formation.
