This MQL5 trading robot works in real-time market environment. The trading robot is fully functional on Metatrader 5 platform.


There are two seperate algorithms trading two different strategies:

1. The trend follower algorithm trades breakouts of the box formation of previous candles.

Let's say your backtesting results show you that July and August are bad months for trading. You can disable trading for up to four months every year. You can tell the EA to close all open trades when the disabled month begins by enabling "Close open trade when vacation starts?" option.
